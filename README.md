# Compile-time getopt in C

...and a rather cursed one at that.

## Why?

That's an excellent question.

## How?

For now you'll just have to look at the example code. (Those are the sources that aren't named `letopt.c` or `letopt.h`.)

## Why?

It generates `--help` output at compile time. With correct alignment. In C. If you don't see the fun in that, congratulations, you're normal.
